# Anonymous Email

## Problem Statement

Giving out email address as a primary identifier online has been the standard
since the advent of the internet. Currently, many use hacks to identify services
the expose email address, such as adding `+text` to gmail addresses (everything
after the `+` gets ignored). Few services expose a mechanism to *easily*
generate temporary or per-service "sub-addresses".

Defining a sub-address as an alternative email address who's messages get
forwarded to a main inbox. While it's possible to do something similar with
conventional email service providers (ie. gmail), the interface is either
manual, or clunky.

## Ideas

An email service, providing standard inbox, that makes the ability to generate
per-service or temporary email addresses. For familiarity, we can use a similar
format to gmails, where addresses are the main address with a `+sometext`
appended to the address. For fully anonymous addresses, it could be possible to
encrypt the addresses and encode them in base32 (decrypting in the MTA). This
would allow for *fully* anonymous per-service email addresses, as the master
address can potentialy include sensitive information (such as real name).

## Problems

Usability is the primary concern. Most people probably don't know or care about
the types of information leakage that come from using an email address as a
primary identifier.
