# Manual Focusing

What people used to do, mostly, before autofocus systems got pretty good.

See [this](https://petapixel.com/2016/03/15/guide-mastering-manual-focus/) for a
good introduction on the basic of manual focusing. Requires practice and using
the same lens for awhile to get the hang of knowing what's in or will be in
focus.

Some basic tips:

* Use a higher aperture. The higher, the larger the 'zone' will be in focus
* Practice
