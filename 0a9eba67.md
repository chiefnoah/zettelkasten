# Zettelkasten

Zettelkasten is a note taking that aims to organize notes in a way
that matches how the human brain organizes thoughts: in a graph of
interconnected ideas.

It uses a series of individual notes and references to other notes to build a
natural graph of information. [[[neuron]]] is a tool to create #zettelkasten graphs
using plain [[0de24d86]] files.
