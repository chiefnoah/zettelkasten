# Liminal Spaces

Familiar places shown in an unfamiliar context.

These types of spaces may be characterized by:

* empty rooms in houses, often looking slightly decayed, but not always
* spaces designed for people, but with no or few people present
* locations where function and design become redundant
* places associated with activity, but where that activity is absent

## Notable Examples

* Todd Hido
