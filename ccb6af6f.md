# Skylum Luminar

Luminar is an "AI"-centric photo editing toolkit/software package created by the
company Skylum. It aims to compete with products such as LightRoom while
emphasizing 'smart' features. The current release of Luminar is 4 (Luminar 4)

## Issues

* Performance isn't very good, though not unusable
* Processed/exported images do not look the same as the preview, primarily with
   regards to exposure and colors
* No ability to edit radial masks once created, and overall interface is rather
   clunky, especially compared to LightRoom
