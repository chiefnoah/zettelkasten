# Ambient Noise

The ambient noise of being in a cafe, office, bar, or restaurant can be a
pleasant working environment for some people. For me, it seems to help focus and
creativity and is something I miss in my #WFH situation.

Apps and sites are available to help fill the gap of ambient noise while working
from somewhere normally silent (such as my bedroom). Below are some examples of
apps.
