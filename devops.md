# DevOps

Development operations. Typically a job or role of a software engineer or system
administrator who's job it is to facilitate the development, testing, and
deployment of code within a company.

More conceptually, it's *thing* that people assign different tasks that are part
of the software development lifecycle.

Common tasks include handling deployment of code to a VM, cluster (such as
[[2687a2db]]#), monitoring, and optional rollback.


## Tools

Some tools that would fall under that category of "devops".

* [aviary.sh](https://github.com/team-video/aviary.sh)
  * A bash-powered distributed configuration management toolkit, `bash`!
