# DevOps

Development operations. Typically a job or role of a software engineer or system
administrator who's job it is to facilitate the development, testing, and
deployment of code within a company.

More conceptually, it's *thing* that people assign different tasks that are part
of the software development lifecycle.

Common tasks include handling deployment of code to a VM, cluster (such as
[[2687a2db]]#), monitoring, and optional rollback.
