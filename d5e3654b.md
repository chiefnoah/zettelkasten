# Instagram Post Hashtags

Hashtags are annoying things you generally have to add to a post to get
increased visibility to appease the algorithm gods. As with every other
'hashtag', they begin with a `#`.

## Fujifilm Street Photography

Copied these from one of [[71c5abfe]]'s instagram posts. They should probably
be tweaked. I've already deleted 1 of the tags, so there's likely room for 1
more.

Use these for street photos taken with the #[[07df093c]].
