# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform. Often abbreviated "k8s" (for
some reason). It's now the predominant platform for orchestrating clusters of
containers. Originally built on top of Docker, Kubernetes is generally Linux
specific and runs on top of at least one Linux server in most configuration.

It's main interface is through `yaml` files and the primary means of configuring
it is through the `kubectl` command line utility.

Several other "distributions" of kubernetes exist, such as RedHat's
[OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/), which aims to enhance and reimplement
portions of the kubernetes ecosystem aimed primarily at enterprise use.
