# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform. Often abbreviated "k8s" (for
some reason). It's now the predominant platform for orchestrating clusters of
containers. Originally built on top of [[e8257bd0]], Kubernetes is generally Linux
specific and runs on top of at least one Linux server in most configuration.

It's main interface is through `yaml` files and the primary means of configuring
it is through the `kubectl` command line utility.

Several other "distributions" of kubernetes exist, such as RedHat's
[OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/), which aims to enhance and reimplement
portions of the kubernetes ecosystem aimed primarily at enterprise use.
