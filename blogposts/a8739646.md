# Unstructured Feeds are **SO** Much Better Than Karma Systems

### Or, why RSS is still relevant in 2021

I'd like to preface this by saying, this is what works for _me_. I'm not trying
to make any broad claims about how terrible your doomscroll inducing social
media feed[^1] is, just that these small changes I've found have had a
noticeable impact on my day-to-day browsing habits.

## The Switch

I stopped browsing my main two sources of tech news directly: [HackerNews][2]
and [Lobste.rs][3].

Instead, I replaced them with a hosted RSS feed aggregator called [Miniflux][4].
This isn't the first time I've attempted to use an RSS aggregator to manage my
news feed, but it is the first that that it's stuck. The UI is clean, usable,
and concise and has support for external clients via the (now aging) Fever API.
The external client support allows me to use the [Reeder][5] app on my phone,
should I need to (which isn't very often these days). Perhaps controversial, but
despite being [free and Open Source][6] I opted to pay for the hosted version of
Miniflux. The developer of Miniflux chooses to do something that I'd like to see
more from small open source projects: offer reasonably priced hosting (when
applicable and feasible) for their software.

At $15/year, the price is well
within reason, and it saves me the headache of setting up yet another
[PostgreSQL][7] instance all while giving some (albeit, small) support to the
developer.

## Sometimes more **is** less

What I found most surprising about switching to a RSS-based news feed was that I
notice more news/articles/posts than before. As someone who takes care to
maintain [inbox zero][8] as much as reasonable, I like to keep the `Unread`
section of my news feed clean. This means that whenever I check my feed, I
generally parse through the titles of each item and decide whether I'm actually
interested in reading or not, and mark it as read if I'm not, or click into it
if I am[^2]. This process is faster than going to the each individual site and
parsing through whatever happens to be on the front page at the time. Another
nice property of this is that I don't have to do this multiple times for the
same article, each one shows up in my feed once and only once [^3]. This is
feeds into another key benefit: being able to keep up to date on more niche and
obscure blogs.


## The Give and Take of Karma

Upvote, downvote, star, flag, bookmark, heart, like. Karma systems are a means
of crowdsourcing the aggregation and filtering of content. While it's pretty
effective at filtering down [^4] content, the bias and distraction introduced by
the score and comment counts aren't really worth it in my opinion. Now, to be
clear, karma systems still have an important role and I still use them
*indirectly*. Because of this, I end up dropping into comments less (despite
being just as easy in Miniflux).

## The Rest

Unfortunately, it seems RSS (and Atom) have started to fall out of favor. One of
my favorite news sites, Reuters, killed their RSS feeds sometime last year. I
still haven't found a reliable and trustworthy way to get my Reddit feed into
RSS [^5]. Despite this, I a good chunk of blogs and podcast sites still support
it, including some other sites that I didn't expect such as [Nebula][9].

[^1]: Yes, this isn't really about *feeds* necessarily, at least not in the
      Twitter/Facebook/Instagram sense
[^2]: Sometimes I'll leave articles in my unread if I don't have time to read
      them immediately, but generally my inbox is cleared by the end of the day
[^3]: Excluding articles posted to multiple of my feed sources
[^4]: to the most controverial, clickbatey
[^5]: I'm not really looking for one either, Reddit is more for memes. Don't @
      me
