A photographer from western New Jersey. Many of his images capture outdoor
man-made structures completely devoid of people, often inspiring a feeling of
stillness and tranquility. His colors are saturated and often unnatural, but not
distractingly so and still have a soft look to them.

His [website](https://kohldonnelly.com) has much of his work, including digital
versions of his "zines", which have physical copies available for purchase as
well.
