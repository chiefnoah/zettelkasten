# CockroachDB

* A distributed database
* Has real-time consistency
* Geo-partitioning
  * Forcing data to stay in specific region
  * Not specifically GDPR compliant
* Has backups, streaming to a data warehouse
* Looks to have some support for PostGIS, which could potentially be used as a
   graph database
