# DNS Zone Transfer

Known as an AXFR request, a #DNS Zone Transfer is a type of transaction used to
duplicate DNS records for a zone. It can theoretically be used to enumerate
subdomains for a domain, which constitudes a potential security risk.

Uses TCP and a client-server style transaction. The requesting server may be a
secondary/replica server.
