# IPO

#### How a company gets to an Initial Public Offering (IPO)

Starts with hiring/partnering with investment banker. Usually "bulge-bracket
banks" (really large ones), but sometimes "boutique banks" (smaller banks).
After parnering and kickoff, due diligence to prepare for SEC S-1 filing begin.

## Due Diligence

During this process, only a "working group" is generally aware of the plans of
IPO. There's several compliance and financial audits take place, and there's
lawyers involved.

## Filing

Once the S-1 is filed, a company is legally required to make a public
announcement about the upcoming IPO.
