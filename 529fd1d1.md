# Zig Programming Language

Considered by some to be a viable C replacement for low-level systems
programming, Zig aims to be a simple language with strong memory safety and
language constructs for writing safe and fast code. It recently became
self-hosting, meaning a compiler writen in Zig is available, but is intended
primarily for testing. The main compiler uses the LLVM ecosystem for both speed
and robust platform compatibility.

## Features

* C ABI compatibility
* [[[2b532fa6]]]
