# ZFS.rent

A simple cloud hosting service with a rent-to-own model for storage drives.

Only has 8TB drives, 4GB of ECC RAM and a dedicated IPv4 address on a KVM VPS.

## Questions

* Can I send my own drives?
* Can I have more than 1 drive?
* Do I get more CPU/RAM for having more drives?


Pricing Model has since changed:
