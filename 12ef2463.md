# Classic Chrome

A film simulation created by Fujifilm. Intended to look good for
photojournalism, street photography. Mimic the look a picture had in a magazine
or newspaper in the 70's~. Fuji claims it's not mimicking anything, but most
likely it's mimicking Kodak Kodachrome as it was the most used film stock in
that time period, except *printed*. So really, it's not based on a film stock,
but on the common printed form of that film stock.

## Details

* Removes a lot of the magentas, reds

## When to use?

* Looks ok for personal stuff
* Too desaturated for things such as profiles/headshots
* Personal preference... like everything
