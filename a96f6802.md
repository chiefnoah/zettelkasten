# Containers

Containers a similar to a lightweight virtual maching (VM), but instead of
virtualizing hardware and running a new kernel and userspace on top, it uses a
series of OS namespacing constructs to confine processes to a subset of a
filesystem and process group. While this incurs significantly less overhead than
running a full VM, the isolation is potentially less strict and methods of
breaking out of the namespace confinement may be possible. Further, because
processes run on "bare metal", hardware exploits are a larger concern though
even these can be mitigated by limiting direct hardware access and virtualizing
subsets of device files.

Some notable implementations include [[e8257bd0]]#, runc, and crun. Containers
also form the basis for [[2687a2db]]#, a "distributed operating system" and
container orchestrator thas has taken over the infrastructure space.
